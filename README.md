# Gatsby-fied Create React App Portfolio

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) was then added on to allow the use of markdown files for content.

## Local Install
Global install the Gatsby CLI via

`npm i -g gatsby-cli`

After Gatsby is installed run `gatsby develop` to run on local.

## Available Scripts

Pre-Gatsby-fication, this project allowed running the usual CRA commands:
- `yarn start`: Runs the app in the development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `yarn test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode
- `yarn build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder
- `yarn eject`: One-way operation to open up CRA for customization

Gatsby was added in commit [a004860](https://github.com/RasyadiAbdoellah/react-portfolio/commit/a004860793ba26b08e56046a247fc1b107a1855b). From that point on, the only commands that work are Gatsby CLI commands. [Full list of Gatsby CLI commands here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/gatsby-cli/)
